## Following users

you should be able to. Once we have this, the dashboard should be changed to privilege posts by the people you're following.

## Infinite scroll on the dashboard

I hear that kaminari is useful for this.


## Reimplement all the views using React.js



## User preferences

Users should have and be able to edit:

- profile pic
- blog description
- whether you have to ask to follow them
- whether they only accept messages from people they're following
- a list of words (like "torture, meat") that they have blocked
- a list of tags that they've blocked


## Messaging

Users should be able to send each other messages.

There should be an inbox, an outbox, and messages threaded by user.
